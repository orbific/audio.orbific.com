### The Remains of Mr Pootles

*The Remains of Mr Pootles* was the first clown story I wrote. It was written as part of my MA at Sussex, and is still one of my favourite stories. It appeared in print in Succour Magazine, back in 2006.  

After reading, I briefly talk about the first clown story that I tried to write from before the MA, when I was on the creative writing certificate course.
