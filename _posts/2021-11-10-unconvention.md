### The Invibles

This is a talk that I gave back in October, at the [27th Annual Invisibles Unconvention](https://orbific.com/things-that-happened/the-27th-annual-invisibles-unconvention/). The talk discusses The Invisibles comic book; how it relates to the present world and counter-culture. 

Please note that I use the incorrect pronouns for the comic's author, Grant Morrison, who recently asked to be referred to by they/them pronouns. I apologise for this.
