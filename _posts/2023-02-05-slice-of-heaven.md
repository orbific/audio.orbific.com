### A Slice of Heaven on Earth

I wrote this story last month for my writing workshop. It's part of my longer South Downs Way writing project, and describes on the Devil's hobbies: visiting parties at village halls.

It will eventually be published in one of my pamphlets, but probably not for a year or two.
