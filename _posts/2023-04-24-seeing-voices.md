### Seeing Voices

This is a very short story, just over a minute long, about hauntings during the pandemic. I wrote it for the most recent session of the Todmorden Wednesday Writers.

The piece was written as a horror story, but reading it aloud, the group laughed at some of the images. I'm OK with that. Horror and laughter are closely linked. While I find the images in this story horrifying, they are also amusing.
