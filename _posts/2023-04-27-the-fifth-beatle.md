### The Fifth Beatle

The Fifth Beatle is a short sci-fi story about the Beatles in the style of Philip K Dickâ€™s paranoid novels.

This came about from me messing around writing pulp genre scenes about the Beatles, imagining a whole movement of Beatlepunk. There were stories about the Beatles as mecha who defended Liverpool from Kaiju; about Ringo becoming a werewolf; and about Paul McCartney buying a copy of the Necronomicon.

As the 1960s get further away, the Beatles come to seem more mythic than ever. They slip into these stories easily.
