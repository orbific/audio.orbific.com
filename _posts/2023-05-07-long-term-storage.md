### Long Term Storage


This is a very short story about clowns. I've written a lot of stories about clowns over the years. It started from an assignment in a creative writing class, and grew from there. I worked on a collection, 'Clown Stories: Volume 1'm but it never quite saw the light. I'm thinking I should finish it this year.
